## Configuration

### How to Run It on Your Local Machine

**Prerequisites**

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip installed

**Steps to Run**

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shah91n/WeaviateCluster.git
    cd WeaviateCluster
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the app:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py
    ```

If you haven't already created a `requirements.txt` file, here's what it should look like:

```text
streamlit
weaviate-client
requests
pandas
```

Or You can also run the Weaviate Cluster using Docker. Follow the steps below to build the Docker image and run the container:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shah91n/WeaviateCluster.git
    cd WeaviateCluster
    ```

2. **Build the Docker image:**

    ```bash
    docker build -t weaviateclusterapp:latest .
    ```

3. **Run the Docker container:**

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8501:8501 --add-host=localhost:host-gateway weaviateclusterapp
    ```

This will start the Weaviate Cluster, and you can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.

### How to Run It on a Cloud Cluster

1. Provide the Weaviate endpoint.
2. Provide the API key.
3. Connect and enjoy!

### Notes

This is a personal project and is not officially approved by the Weaviate organization. While functional, the code may not follow all best practices for Python programming or Streamlit. Suggestions and improvements are welcome!

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**: While this tool is designed for cluster operation and analysis, there is always a possibility of unknown bugs. However, this tool is intended for read-only operations.
